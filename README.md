Effect Hook (useEffect): Fetching data when the component mounts or updates (DetailsPage).
Props and PropTypes: Passing and validating props (DetailsPage).

2. React Router (react-router-dom)
Routing Setup: Using Router, Routes, and Route to manage navigation.
Dynamic Routing: Using URL parameters (useParams) to fetch movie details.
